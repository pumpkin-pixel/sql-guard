## Why Does This Exist?

One bad SQL query can delete production data, expose customer records, or bring down a database. Most teams only find out after the damage is done. sql-sop catches dangerous patterns automatically — before the query ever runs — in 0.08 seconds.

### Key Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| Rules | 43 (10 errors, 28 warnings, 5 Python-source); 48 with `--contract` |
| Tests | 210 |
| Coverage | 86% |
| Scan speed | 0.08s across 200 files |
| PyPI downloads | 500+/month |
| Version | 0.7.0 |

### Fluent API (v0.2.0)

```python
from sql_guard import SqlGuard

result = SqlGuard().enable("E001", "W001").scan("DELETE FROM users")
print(result.passed)    # False
print(result.summary()) # "1 error, 0 warnings in 1 statement"
```

---

Fast, rule-based SQL linter. 43 rules (38 SQL + 5 Python), with an optional Contracts pack (5 schema-aware rules) when you supply `--contract path.yml`. SQL Server-focused rules for T-SQL shops. Inline disable, project config, git-changed-only mode, and SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning. 500+ monthly downloads on PyPI.

Catches dangerous SQL before it reaches production -- DELETE without WHERE, UPDATE without WHERE, SQL injection patterns, SELECT *, contract drift, and 40+ more. Runs as a **CLI tool**, **pre-commit hook**, and **GitHub Action**.

Used in production data pipelines to lint SQL before it reaches manufacturing ERP databases. Prevents dangerous patterns like DELETE without WHERE from running against production SI Integreater tables.

For deeper AI-powered analysis, pair with [SQL Ops Reviewer](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-ops-reviewer).

## Quick start

**If sql-sop catches a real bug for you, a GitHub star is the easiest way
to help — it makes the project more discoverable for people with the same
problem.**

```bash
pip install sql-sop
sql-sop check .

# Also scan .py files for SQL hazards in execute()/read_sql() calls:
pip install "sql-sop[python]"
sql-sop check . --include-python
```

```
queries/create_orders.sql
  L3:  ERROR [E001] DELETE without WHERE clause -- this will delete all rows
         -> Add a WHERE clause to limit affected rows
  L7:  WARN  [W001] SELECT * -- specify columns explicitly
         -> Replace with: SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM ...

Found 2 issues (1 error, 1 warning) in 1 file (0.001s)
```

## The two-layer SQL quality pipeline

Most teams have **no SQL review process**. Some use an AI linter. The problem: AI is slow, expensive, and overkill for catching `DELETE FROM users;`.

sql-sop and SQL Ops Reviewer solve this together:

**Layer 1 (sql-guard)** is a smoke detector -- always on, instant, catches fire fast.
**Layer 2 (SQL Ops Reviewer)** is a fire inspector -- thorough, comes on every PR.

You want both.

---

## Set up the full pipeline (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Pre-commit hook (Layer 1)

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard
    rev: v0.7.0
    hooks:
      - id: sql-guard
        args: [--severity, error]  # only block on errors locally
```

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Now every `git commit` with `.sql` changes runs sql-guard automatically. Errors block the commit. Warnings are shown but don't block.

### Step 2: GitHub Actions (Layer 1 + Layer 2)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/sql-quality.yml
name: SQL Quality
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['**/*.sql']

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  # Layer 1: fast rule check (~2 seconds)
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Pawansingh3889/sql-guard@v1
        with:
          severity: warning

  # Layer 2: deep AI review (~30 seconds, runs after lint passes)
  review:
    needs: lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Pawansingh3889/sql-ops-reviewer@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it. Two files. Every SQL change gets:
1. Instant rule-based lint (sql-guard)
2. Deep AI review with fix suggestions (SQL Ops Reviewer)

### Step 3 (optional): CLI for manual checks

```bash
pip install sql-sop

sql-sop check .                          # scan current directory
sql-sop check queries/ --severity error  # errors only
sql-sop check . --fail-fast              # stop on first error
sql-sop check . --disable E002 W008      # skip specific rules
sql-sop list-rules                       # show every registered rule
```

## Rules

### Errors (block commit by default)

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| E001 | `delete-without-where` | `DELETE FROM orders;` -- deletes all rows |
| E002 | `drop-without-if-exists` | `DROP TABLE users;` -- fails if table missing |
| E003 | `grant-revoke` | `GRANT SELECT ON users TO public;` -- privilege escalation |
| E004 | `string-concat-in-where` | `WHERE id = '' + @input` -- SQL injection |
| E005 | `insert-without-columns` | `INSERT INTO t VALUES (...)` -- breaks on schema change |
| E006 | `update-without-where` | `UPDATE orders SET status = 'x';` -- overwrites every row |
| E007 | `alter-add-not-null-no-default` | `ALTER TABLE t ADD c INT NOT NULL;` -- locks table for full rewrite |
| E008 | `drop-column` | `ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c;` -- irreversible, breaks subscribers |

### Warnings (advisory by default)

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| W001 | `select-star` | `SELECT * FROM users` -- pulls unnecessary columns |
| W002 | `missing-limit` | Unbounded SELECT -- could return millions of rows |
| W003 | `function-on-column` | `WHERE YEAR(date) = 2024` -- kills index usage |
| W004 | `missing-alias` | JOIN without table aliases -- hard to read |
| W005 | `subquery-in-where` | `WHERE x IN (SELECT ...)` -- often slower than JOIN |
| W006 | `orderby-without-limit` | ORDER BY without LIMIT -- sorts entire result |
| W007 | `hardcoded-values` | `WHERE amount > 10000` -- use parameters |
| W008 | `mixed-case-keywords` | `select ... FROM` -- inconsistent casing |
| W009 | `missing-semicolon` | Statement not terminated with `;` |
| W010 | `commented-out-code` | `-- SELECT * FROM old_table` -- use version control |
| W011 | `union-without-all` | `UNION` between disjoint sets -- forces a deduplication sort, `UNION ALL` is faster when uniqueness is guaranteed |
| W012 | `group-by-ordinal` | `GROUP BY 1, 2` -- fragile to SELECT-list reorders |
| W013 | `window-missing-partition` | `OVER ()` -- unpredictable results and unclear intent |
| W014 | `case-without-else` | `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END` -- unmatched rows return NULL |
| W015 | `join-function-on-column` | `JOIN customers c ON UPPER(o.email) = UPPER(c.email)` -- kills index seek |
| W016 | `not-in-with-subquery` | `WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT ...)` -- silently returns 0 rows on NULL |
| W017 | `leading-wildcard-like` | `WHERE name LIKE '%smith'` -- non-SARGable, full scan |
| W018 | `or-across-columns` | `WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2` -- defeats single-column indexes |
| W019 | `count-distinct-unbounded` | `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` with no WHERE / GROUP BY / LIMIT -- full sort + distinct over the whole table |
| W020 | `truncate-table` | `TRUNCATE TABLE staging;` -- bypasses triggers, resets identity |
| W022 | `cross-join-explicit` | `FROM products CROSS JOIN regions` -- Cartesian product, confirm intent |
| W023 | `scalar-udf-in-where` | `WHERE dbo.fn_X(col) = 1` -- row-by-row predicate evaluation |
| W024 | `select-distinct-suspicious` | `SELECT DISTINCT a, b FROM x JOIN y ON ...` -- DISTINCT often masks a missing join condition or GROUP BY |


### Structural (v0.3.0+, sqlparse-based)

Rules that need an AST view of the statement, parsed via sqlparse. Catch
issues that single-line regex matching cannot reliably see.

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| S001 | `implicit-cross-join` | `JOIN customers` with no `ON` / `USING` -- accidental Cartesian product |
| S002 | `deeply-nested-subquery` | Subqueries beyond 3 levels deep -- typically a refactor opportunity |
| S003 | `unused-cte` | `WITH x AS (...)` defined but never referenced |

### T-SQL (v0.5.0+)

Rules targeting SQL Server anti-patterns common in legacy stored procs
and SSRS datasets. Fire on text patterns that do not appear in BigQuery
or Postgres code, so they run unconditionally with near-zero false
positives on non-T-SQL input.

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| T001 | `with-nolock` | `SELECT * FROM t WITH (NOLOCK)` -- dirty reads |
| T002 | `xp-cmdshell` | `EXEC xp_cmdshell ...` -- shell-exec surface |
| T003 | `cursor-declaration` | `DECLARE c CURSOR FOR ...` -- row-by-row processing |
| T004 | `deprecated-outer-join` | `WHERE a.x *= b.y` -- removed in SQL Server 2012+ |
| T005 | `create-index-without-online` | `CREATE INDEX ix ON t (...)` -- locks table; add `WITH (ONLINE = ON)` |
| T006 | `select-into-without-typed-fields` | `SELECT * INTO target FROM source` -- destination schema is inferred at runtime |

### Contracts (opt-in via `--contract`)

Pass `--contract path/to/contract.yml` (or set `contract:` in
`.sql-guard.yml`) to lint queries against the expected schema. Without a
contract these rules are silent. Format is a thin subset of the open
data-contract space; see `tests/fixtures/contract_sample.yml` for a
working example.

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| C001 | `column-not-in-contract` | `SELECT o.bogus FROM orders o` -- column not declared for that table |
| C002 | `table-not-in-contract` | `SELECT * FROM ghost_table` -- table absent from the contract |
| C003 | `not-null-violation` | `INSERT INTO orders (id) VALUES (1)` -- omits a NOT NULL column |
| C004 | `primary-key-missing-on-insert` | INSERT omits a PK column with no default |
| C005 | `unmapped-fk` | `JOIN ... ON o.id = c.id` -- columns have no FK relationship in the contract |
| C006 | `column-type-mismatch-on-insert` | `INSERT INTO orders (total) VALUES ('not a number')` -- value's literal kind disagrees with the contract type |

Two helper subcommands round out the workflow:

```bash
# Bootstrap a contract from an existing database (requires sql-sop[snapshot]):
sql-sop schema-snapshot \
  --dsn "mssql+pyodbc://user:pass@host/db?driver=ODBC+Driver+18+for+SQL+Server" \
  --output contract.yml

# Validate a contract YAML structure before running rules (CI-friendly):
sql-sop validate-contract --contract contract.yml
```

### Python scanning (v0.4.0+, opt-in)

Enable with `pip install "sql-sop[python]"` and `--include-python`. Uses
libCST to walk Python source and extract SQL strings from `.execute()`,
`.read_sql()`, `sqlalchemy.text(...)` calls and `sql =`/`query =` style
assignments. Then applies every rule above, plus four that only make
sense at the Python level:

| ID | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| P001 | `fstring-in-execute` | `cursor.execute(f"... {user_input}")` -- SQL injection |
| P002 | `concat-in-execute` | `cursor.execute("..." + user_input)` -- SQL injection |
| P003 | `format-in-execute` | `.format()` or `%` interpolation into an execute call |
| P004 | `bare-variable-in-execute` | `cursor.execute(query)` where `query` is an unchecked variable |
| P005 | `sqlalchemy-text-fstring` | `sqlalchemy.text(f"... {var}")` -- SQL injection on the SQLAlchemy text() surface |

---

## Configuration

### Disable specific rules

```bash
sql-sop check . --disable E002 W008 W010
```

### Project config file (`.sql-guard.yml`)

Drop a `.sql-guard.yml` (or `.sql-guard.yaml`) at the repo root. The loader walks up from the current directory; CLI flags merge with and override these settings.

```yaml
disable:
  - W005
  - T001
ignore:
  - migrations/legacy/
  - vendor/
include_python: true
severity: warning
```

### Inline disable comments

Silence a known false positive on a single line, no project-wide override needed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM lookups; -- sql-guard: disable=W001
SELECT * FROM users  -- sql-guard: disable=W001,W002
WHERE name LIKE '%smith';

-- sql-guard: disable-next-line=W017
SELECT * FROM events WHERE name LIKE '%checkout';
```

A bare `-- sql-guard: disable` (no equals sign) silences every rule on the line. The same directives work in Python with `#` instead of `--`.

### Lint only changed files

For pre-commit and CI on big repos:

```bash
sql-sop check . --changed-only                      # working tree
sql-sop check . --changed-only --changed-base main  # vs a branch ref
```

Falls back to a full scan with a warning when not in a git repo.

### Severity filtering

```bash
sql-sop check . --severity error    # only show errors
sql-sop check . --severity warning  # show everything (default)
```

### Fail fast

```bash
sql-sop check . --fail-fast  # stop after first error found
```

### SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning

Render findings inline on PRs in the GitHub Files Changed view:

```bash
sql-sop check . --format sarif --output results.sarif
```

In a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- run: sql-sop check . --format sarif --output sql-guard.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: sql-guard.sarif
```

---

## Performance

sql-guard is designed to be fast:

- **Compiled regex** -- patterns compiled once at startup, reused per file
- **Two-pass scanning** -- single-line rules run first (8 of 20 SQL rules), multi-line parsing only when needed
- **Line-by-line streaming** -- files read line by line, not loaded entirely into memory
- **Early exit** -- `--fail-fast` stops on first error

```
Benchmark: 200 SQL files, 20 SQL rules
  sql-guard:  0.08 seconds
  sqlfluff:   45 seconds (560x slower)
```

---

## Production Use Case

In a fish production environment, sql-sop runs as a pre-commit hook on all SQL that touches ERP data (RunNumber, OCM tables). Combined with read-only database users and Docker isolation, it forms part of a 6-layer safety architecture that prevents accidental writes to the production ERP.

---

## How it compares

| | sql-sop | sqlfluff | sql-lint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rules | 31 (focused) | 800+ (comprehensive) | ~20 |
| Speed | <0.1s for 200 files | 45s for 200 files | ~2s |
| Config needed | Zero | Extensive | Minimal |
| Language | Python | Python | JavaScript |
| Pre-commit | Yes | Yes | No |
| GitHub Action | Yes | Community | No |
| AI integration | Pairs with SQL Ops Reviewer | No | No |

sql-sop is not a replacement for sqlfluff. It's a fast first pass that catches 80% of real issues with zero setup. If you need dialect-specific formatting and 800 rules, use sqlfluff. If you want instant feedback on dangerous SQL, use sql-guard.

### Adding a new rule

1. Create a class in `sql_guard/rules/errors.py` or `warnings.py`
2. Inherit from `Rule`, set `id`, `name`, `severity`, `description`
3. Override `check_line()` for single-line rules or `check_statement()` for multi-line
4. Add to `ALL_RULES` in `sql_guard/rules/__init__.py`
5. Add a test in `tests/test_rules.py`
6. Add a trigger case in `tests/fixtures/`

```python
class MyNewRule(Rule):
    id = "W011"
    name = "my-rule"
    severity = "warning"
    description = "What this rule catches"
    multiline = False

    _pattern = Rule._compile(r"your regex here")

    def check_line(self, line, line_number, file):
        if self._pattern.search(line):
            return Finding(
                rule_id=self.id,
                severity=self.severity,
                file=file,
                line=line_number,
                message="What went wrong",
                suggestion="How to fix it",
            )
        return None
```

PRs welcome. Keep rules simple, keep patterns fast.
