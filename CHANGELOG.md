# Changelog

All notable changes to **sql-sop** are logged here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
sql-sop uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Rule removals and rule ID renames are **breaking changes** that require
a deprecation window (see `GOVERNANCE.md` § Scope discipline).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **C006 `column-type-mismatch-on-insert`** (error) - flags `INSERT`
  statements where a value literal's kind disagrees with the contract
  column type. Coarse buckets (numeric / string / date / boolean)
  catch the common copy-paste class: `INSERT INTO orders (total)
  VALUES ('not a number')` when `total` is `decimal`. Lenient on
  `NULL`, parameter placeholders (`?`, `%s`, `:name`, `@name`, `$1`),
  function calls, and bare identifiers, since their type can't be
  decided statically. Multi-row INSERTs are walked tuple-by-tuple
  with a paren-and-quote-aware splitter so commas inside string
  literals or function arguments don't break the parse. Resolves #44.
- **W021 `having-without-group-by`** - warns when `HAVING` appears
  without a preceding `GROUP BY` in the same query block. The query
  becomes a single implicit group, almost always a typo for `WHERE`.
  Strips line and block comments before matching and tracks paren
  depth so a `GROUP BY` inside a subquery does not satisfy a `HAVING`
  in the outer query. Known limitation: nested grouped subqueries
  with their own `HAVING` (depth >0) can produce a false positive.
  Contributed by [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)
  ([#39](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/39)).
  Resolves #3.
- **E009 `update-from-without-join`** (error) - flags
  `UPDATE ... FROM a, b WHERE ...` and similar comma-separated FROM
  clauses on UPDATE statements. T-SQL accepts this legacy implicit
  join: get the WHERE wrong (or omit it) and every row in the target
  table is updated against the Cartesian product. Severity is error
  rather than warning (the sister rule S001 covers SELECT FROM
  comma-joins as a warning) because the failure mode is a write that
  touches every row of a table. Walk-from-UPDATE-keyword,
  paren-depth-aware scan reusing the `strip_strings_and_comments`
  helper from `base.py`. `, LATERAL ...` is recognised as a
  legitimate Snowflake/Postgres lateral join and not flagged.
  Resolves #42.
- **T006 `select-into-without-typed-fields`** (warning) - flags
  T-SQL `SELECT * INTO target FROM source` because the destination
  table's schema is derived from whatever the source produces at
  execution time. If the source columns change shape (a column added,
  type widened, an index changed) the destination silently adopts
  those changes and any code reading from `target` finds the schema
  has shifted underneath it. Recommended pattern: `CREATE TABLE
  target (...)` with explicit typed columns, then `INSERT INTO target
  (col1, ...) SELECT col1, ...`. Fires only on the wildcard form;
  the explicit-column variant (`SELECT col1, col2 INTO target FROM
  source`) is allowed through here and covered by the contracts pack
  at C001/C003 if a column type drifts. Resolves #43.
- **W024 `select-distinct-suspicious`** (warning) - fires when a
  statement contains both top-level `SELECT DISTINCT` and any `JOIN`
  keyword. The pattern is a common band-aid for a missing join
  condition or a missing `GROUP BY`: developers reach for `DISTINCT`
  to swallow row duplication caused by an over-wide JOIN cardinality
  rather than fixing the join. Standalone `SELECT DISTINCT col FROM t`
  (no join) is left alone, and aggregate-DISTINCT forms like
  `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` are not flagged because the regex anchors on
  `SELECT` directly preceding `DISTINCT`. String literals and comments
  are stripped first so a mention of "SELECT DISTINCT" inside a string
  or comment cannot fire the rule. Resolves #40.

### Fixed

- **S001 `implicit-cross-join`** - the previous regex only matched a
  comma immediately after the first word after `FROM`. Most real-world
  comma-joins slipped through silently: aliased tables
  (`FROM orders o, customers c`), schema-qualified names
  (`FROM raw.orders, raw.customers`), three-or-more-way joins, and
  multi-line layouts. Replaced with a paren-depth-aware scan that
  walks from each `FROM` keyword to the next `WHERE` / `GROUP BY` /
  `ORDER BY` / `HAVING` / `LIMIT` / explicit `JOIN` / `UNION` /
  `EXCEPT` / `INTERSECT`, flagging the first depth-0 comma. Strings
  and comments are stripped first. `DELETE FROM` is skipped.
  `, LATERAL ...` is recognised as a legitimate
  Snowflake/Postgres lateral join and not flagged. Resolves #41
  (the W027 comma-join request was a duplicate of S001).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-02

Headline release: schema-aware linting via the new **Contracts pack**, three community-contributed rules (W014 / W015 / W022), and the `schema-snapshot` and `validate-contract` subcommands. Core registry is 43 rules (10 errors, 28 warnings, 5 Python-source). With `--contract` enabled the registry grows to 48 rules (12 errors, 31 warnings, 5 Python-source). Without `--contract` behaviour is identical to v0.6.x and there are no breaking changes.

### Added

- **W014 `case-without-else`** - warns when a `CASE ... END` block has
  no `ELSE` branch, so unmatched rows return `NULL`. Walks the
  statement token-by-token tracking nesting, so an outer `CASE` with no
  `ELSE` still fires even when an inner `CASE` does have one. Fires per
  unmatched block. Suggests adding `ELSE NULL` for explicitness.
  Contributed by [@hellozzm](https://github.com/hellozzm)
  ([#32](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/32)).
- **W015 `join-function-on-column`** - warns when a function wraps a
  column inside a `JOIN ... ON` predicate, the JOIN-side companion to W003.
  `JOIN customers c ON UPPER(o.email) = UPPER(c.email)` defeats every
  index on the joined column. The pattern stops at the next clause keyword
  (`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, the next `JOIN`, or `UNION`)
  so a clean JOIN with a dirty WHERE leaves W015 quiet and lets W003 own
  that case. Contributed by [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)
  ([#33](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/33)).
- **W022 `cross-join-explicit`** - warns on explicit `CROSS JOIN`. Cross
  joins multiply every row in the left table with every row in the right
  table (a Cartesian product). Almost always a mistake unless the author
  intends a calendar-grid or lookup-table generation pattern. The pattern
  strips trailing line comments before matching so `-- avoid CROSS JOIN`
  in a trailing comment does not trip the rule. Suppress with
  `-- sql-guard: disable=W022` on the same line. Contributed by
  [@vibeyclaw](https://github.com/vibeyclaw)
  ([#31](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/31)).
- **Contract Rules pack (C001-C005)** - new `--contract path.yml` flag
  loads a data contract describing the expected schema and lints SQL
  against it. Without a contract the rules are silent, so the addition
  is fully backwards-compatible. The contract format is a thin subset
  of the [open data-contract space](https://github.com/datacontract/datacontract-cli):
  tables -> columns -> type / not_null / primary_key / foreign_key /
  has_default. Contract path can also be supplied via `contract:` in
  `.sql-guard.yml`, resolved relative to the config file.
  - **C001 `column-not-in-contract`** (warning): SQL references a column
    that isn't declared in the contract for that table.
  - **C002 `table-not-in-contract`** (warning): statement touches a table
    not declared in the contract. Disable for partial-coverage contracts.
  - **C003 `not-null-violation`** (error): INSERT omits a column that the
    contract marks as NOT NULL with no default.
  - **C004 `primary-key-missing-on-insert`** (error): INSERT omits a
    primary-key column that has no default in the contract.
  - **C005 `unmapped-fk`** (warning): JOIN predicate uses two columns the
    contract has no foreign-key relationship for. Catches accidental
    cross-table joins where the schema declares no relationship between
    the two columns. Resolves the FK in either direction so the JOIN
    column order doesn't matter.
- **`sql-sop schema-snapshot --dsn ... --output contract.yml`** - new
  subcommand. Connects to a live database via SQLAlchemy, introspects
  tables / columns / PKs / FKs / nullable, and writes a contract-shaped
  YAML. Bootstraps the contract workflow: take a snapshot of an existing
  database, commit it as `contract.yml`, then lint queries against it
  via `--contract`. Requires `pip install "sql-sop[snapshot]"`. Supports
  `--schema` (override default schema) and `--include-table` (repeatable,
  for partial snapshots).
- **`sql-sop validate-contract --contract contract.yml`** - new
  subcommand. Loads the contract, validates structure, prints
  table/column/PK/FK counts, exits non-zero on parse failure. Useful in
  CI before `check --contract` so a malformed contract fails fast with a
  readable error rather than an obscure check-time crash.
- W023 `scalar-udf-in-where`: warns on `<schema>.<name>(...)` calls in
  `WHERE`/`HAVING`/`ON` clauses, the canonical T-SQL scalar-UDF
  anti-pattern. Built-ins (no schema prefix) are unaffected.
  ([#30](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/issues/30))

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **W013 `window-without-partition`** - warns on window functions
  using `OVER ()` without `PARTITION BY`, flagging non-deterministic
  ordering and full-result-set scans. Dialect-aware messaging across
  Postgres and Redshift. Contributed by
  [@Prabhu-1409](https://github.com/Prabhu-1409)
  ([#21](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/21)). Resolves #9.

### Repository

- Added [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) describing the v0.7 Performance
  Rules Pack milestone, tentative v0.8 dialect-aware coverage
  direction, and the always-out-of-scope set.
- Added README Contributors section crediting external rule authors
  (currently @tmchow, @mvanhorn, @Prabhu-1409).
- Added `scripts/scaffold_rule.py` for new contributors to generate
  the boilerplate snippets for a new rule.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **W019 `count-distinct-unbounded`** - warns on `COUNT(DISTINCT col)`
  with no `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, or `LIMIT` restricting the scope. Forces
  a full sort + distinct pass over the entire table, a frequent perf
  surprise on prod. Bypass list also recognises T-SQL `TOP` and
  `FETCH FIRST/NEXT`. Contributed by [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)
  ([#29](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/pull/29)). Resolves #7.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **E007 `alter-add-not-null-no-default`** - errors on
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD col TYPE NOT NULL` without a `DEFAULT`. Forces a
  full table rewrite under a schema-modify lock; suggests adding a default
  or splitting into add-nullable / backfill / set-not-null phases.
- **E008 `drop-column`** - errors on `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`.
  Irreversible without backup, breaks replication subscribers, and any
  rollback to the previous deploy fails.
- **W017 `leading-wildcard-like`** - warns on `LIKE '%foo'` with a leading
  wildcard. Non-SARGable; the optimiser cannot use a B-tree index and
  falls back to a full scan. Recognises `N''` (NVARCHAR) literals and
  the `_` single-character wildcard.
- **W018 `or-across-columns`** - warns on `WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2` across
  different columns. Defeats single-column indexes; suggests rewriting
  as `UNION ALL` of two indexed queries.
- **W020 `truncate-table`** - warns on `TRUNCATE TABLE`. Bypasses DELETE
  triggers, resets identity, and gets blocked by FK references.
- **T005 `create-index-without-online`** (T-SQL) - warns when
  `CREATE INDEX` lacks `WITH (ONLINE = ON)`. Default builds hold a
  Sch-M lock for the duration; on busy tables that's a multi-minute
  outage. Suggests disabling on Standard / Express where ONLINE is
  unavailable.
- **Inline disable directives**: `-- sql-guard: disable=W001,W003` (or
  `-- sql-guard: disable-next-line=W001`) silences the listed rules on
  the same or following line. Also recognises `# sql-guard: disable=...`
  in Python source. A bare `-- sql-guard: disable` silences all rules
  on that line.
- **Project config file**: `.sql-guard.yml` (or `.yaml`) at the repo root
  supports `disable:`, `ignore:`, `include_python:`, and `severity:`
  fields. The loader walks up from the cwd. CLI flags merge with and
  override the config.
- **`--changed-only`** flag on `check`. Calls `git diff --name-only`
  (working tree by default; pass `--changed-base origin/main` to compare
  against a ref) and intersects the result with discovered files.
  Speeds up pre-commit on large codebases. Falls back to a full scan
  with a warning when not in a git repo.
- **SARIF output**: `--format sarif` (`-f sarif`) emits a SARIF 2.1.0
  document suitable for the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action,
  so findings render inline on PRs in GitHub Code Scanning. Optional
  `--output results.sarif` writes to a file instead of stdout.

- **P005 `sqlalchemy-text-fstring`** - errors on `sqlalchemy.text(f"...{var}")`.
  Same SQL-injection hazard P001 catches for `cursor.execute()`, but on the
  `sqlalchemy.text()` surface. P001 now skips `text()` call sites so P005
  handles them with a sqlalchemy-specific message and suggestion
  (mirrors the existing P004 `call_name != "text"` guard).
  ([#10](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard/issues/10))
- **W016 `not-in-with-subquery`** - warns on `WHERE col NOT IN (SELECT ...)`.
  When the subquery returns any `NULL`, the predicate evaluates to `UNKNOWN`
  for every outer row and the query silently returns zero results. Suggests
  `NOT EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE ... IS NULL` instead.

### Changed
- `pyyaml` is now a runtime dependency (used by `.sql-guard.yml` loader).
- `--disable` rule IDs are normalised to upper case so `--disable w001`
  and `--disable W001` behave the same.
- Codecov coverage tracking enabled on `main` (baseline 86.05%).

### Changed
- Codecov coverage tracking enabled on `main` (baseline 86.05%).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **T001 `with-nolock`** - warns on `WITH (NOLOCK)` table hints. Causes
  dirty reads. Commonly used as a performance band-aid instead of
  fixing the underlying blocking (indexes, transaction scope, or
  SNAPSHOT isolation).
- **T002 `xp-cmdshell`** - errors on `EXEC xp_cmdshell`. Shell-execution
  surface that should never appear in application SQL.
- **T003 `cursor-declaration`** - warns on `DECLARE ... CURSOR`.
  Row-by-row processing where set-based SQL usually does better.
- **T004 `deprecated-outer-join`** - errors on `*=` and `=*` old-style
  outer-join syntax. Deprecated in SQL Server 2005, unsupported in
  SQL Server 2012 and later. Uses a negative lookbehind to avoid
  matching modern compound-assignment expressions such as `SET @x *= 2`.
- **W012 `group-by-ordinal`** - warns when `GROUP BY` uses positional
  ordinals (`GROUP BY 1, 2`) instead of explicit column names. Ordinal
  references are fragile to `SELECT` list reorders: inserting or
  removing a column silently changes what the query groups by.
  Explicit names are self-documenting and refactor-safe.

### Changed
- W002 `missing-limit` and W006 `orderby-without-limit` now recognise
  T-SQL's `OFFSET n ROWS FETCH NEXT m ROWS ONLY` pagination pattern as
  a bounded query. Previously only `FETCH FIRST` was recognised.
- Single-source the package version via importlib.metadata in sql_guard/__init__.py. pyproject.toml is now the only place a release number is hard-coded.
- sqlparse is now a core dependency. Previously only in the [structural] extra, which meant S001-S003 silently no-op'd for users without it.
- README counts refreshed: 29 rules (6E/12W/3S/4T/4P), version 0.5.0, pre-commit rev v0.5.0.

### Fixed
- `test_duration_tracked` no longer fails on fast hardware where
  `time.perf_counter` resolution is coarser than the scan duration.
  Assertion relaxed from `> 0` to `>= 0` with an explicit float type check.
- Added W014: warn on OVER() without ORDER BY / PARTITION BY to flag non-deterministic window
  functions.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **GitHub Marketplace listing** — `action.yml` now declares `author` and
  `branding` (icon: `shield`, colour: `purple` — safety framing, visually
  distinct from the `check-square`/`blue` default that most linter
  Actions use), plus the previously CLI-only `--include-python` surfaced
  as an action input. Ready to
  publish via the Release UI's "Publish this Action to the GitHub
  Marketplace" toggle.
- **CLI feedback CTA** — when findings are reported, the terminal
  reporter prints a single dim line pointing at the rule-request issue
  template. Never fires on clean runs. Converts each real lint surface
  into a silent engagement ask.
- **Rule-request issue form** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rule-request.yml`
  captures pattern, fail/pass examples, proposed severity, and whether
  the reporter plans to open a PR. Complements the existing
  `feature_request.yml` (which stays for non-rule enhancements).
- **Issue-template config** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` now
  routes usage questions to `Discussions/Q&A` and use-case posts to
  `Discussions/Show-and-tell`, reducing issue-tracker noise.
- **Comparison post** — `docs/blog/sqlfluff-vs-sql-sop.md` — honest
  side-by-side with sqlfluff, positioning sql-sop as a pre-commit
  "smoke detector" alongside sqlfluff's "spell-checker". Includes a
  recommended dual-setup example.
- **Hosted playground (scaffold)** — `playground/index.html` + deploy
  README. Single-file Pyodide-based in-browser linter, ready to serve
  from GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages. No bundler, no build step.
- **Engagement pack** — `docs/engagement/` holds ten
  good-first-issue rule drafts (W011-W018, S004, P005 placeholders),
  a "Who's using sql-sop?" Discussion draft, multi-channel
  announcement post drafts (LinkedIn / Twitter / Reddit / HN), and a
  Marketplace release checklist.

### Contributor paperwork (landed in this release as well)
- `NOTICE`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the "Adding a new rule" walkthrough. Existing
  bug-report and feature-request templates, PR template with the
  rule-addition checklist, CODEOWNERS routing reviews,
  first-contributor welcome workflow, PR-title validator.

### Changed
- **Licence stays MIT, deliberately.** `NOTICE` explains: the package
  has been consumed as MIT on PyPI since v0.1.0; relicensing silently
  is a breaking change for downstream users whose compliance pipelines
  are configured around the current licence.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04

### Added
- **libCST-based Python scanner** — `sql-sop check --include-python`
  walks Python source via libCST (install with `pip install "sql-sop[python]"`).
  Four new rules (`P001`–`P004`) catch SQL injection in `.execute()`,
  `.read_sql()`, and `sqlalchemy.text(...)` calls:
  - P001 `fstring-in-execute` — `cursor.execute(f"... {user_input}")`
  - P002 `concat-in-execute` — `cursor.execute("..." + user_input)`
  - P003 `format-in-execute` — `.format()` / `%` interpolation
  - P004 `bare-variable-in-execute` — `cursor.execute(query)`

### Added (SQL rules)
- **E006 `update-without-where`** — silent twin of E001. Catches
  `UPDATE table SET col = 'x'` with no `WHERE` before it rewrites every
  row. Registered in `ALL_RULES`, fixture line in `tests/fixtures/errors.sql`,
  two tests (fires + does-not-fire-when-WHERE-present).

### Fixed
- **Pattern 16 word-boundary** — `(product|plu).*waste` was greedy-matching
  `production...waste`. Tightened to `\b(product|plu)\b.*waste`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04

### Added
- **Structural rules (S001–S003)** via sqlparse AST:
  - S001 `implicit-cross-join` — missing `ON` / `USING` in `JOIN`
  - S002 `deeply-nested-subquery` — subqueries beyond 3 levels deep
  - S003 `unused-cte` — `WITH` clause defined but never referenced
- **Fluent API** — `SqlGuard().enable("E001").scan("DELETE FROM users")`

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Pre-commit hook + GitHub Action distributions
- Initial CLI with `check` command

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- First release. Core rule engine with 5 errors + 10 warnings.
